## Overview:
Alexa skills are mostly about voice interactions but sometimes visuals can enhance the overall user experience. If that's the case with a skill you're building you've got two options; home cards, and display templates. Home cards are displayed in the Alexa companion App and display templates are shown on screen - which mostly means that - for now - display templates are only visible on the Amazon Echo Show. So, that makes home cards the best option if you want your skill to provide visual content to users regardless of the device they're using.
