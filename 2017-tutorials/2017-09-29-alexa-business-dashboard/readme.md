Want to see how Amazon Alexa can be used in your business? In this video I demo an Amazon Alexa business dashboard that shows some of the business potential for an Alexa custom skill.

### Overview:
This is a demo of a custom Amazon Alexa skill that lets business managers quickly get updates for sales, marketing, finance, support and product development. In addition, the skill lets the manager generate a report that is sent by Alexa via email.

At a high-level, this skill pulls data from different SaaS apps (Hubspot, Xero, GitHub) and other APIs to present business metrics via voice. It's an example of the role Amazon Alexa can play in a business.

If you have questions about how this skill please leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as possible. In a future video, I may do a demo of how to create a similar skill if there is enough interest. So, if you'd like to see that, let me know.
