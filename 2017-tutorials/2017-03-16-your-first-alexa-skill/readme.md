# Creating your first Amazon Alexa Skill in about 11-minutes

This video covers some of the topics in my free Alexa development course at http://dabblelab.com/courses and walks through creating a skill for Amazon Alexa. By using one of the skills templates (aka: blueprints) provided by the Amazon Alexa team, you can get a functional skill working in about 10-minutes. From there you can use the template as a starting point for understanding how to create more detailed skills of your own.
