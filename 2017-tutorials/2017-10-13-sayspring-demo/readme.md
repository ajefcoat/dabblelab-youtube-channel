Lean how to prototype an Alexa skill without writing a single line of code! In this video I'll show you how to quickly prototype your Alexa skill ideas using http://sayspring.com.

### Overview:
This is a demo of Sayspring - a tool for prototyping Alexa skills or Google Home actions. If you have an idea for a skill and you want to get some user feedback before diving into the code, Sayspring is the tool for the job. I'll be creating a prototype for a voice dashboard skill (see that demo here: https://youtu.be/FOZ-hLwkEKI) I created recently and then I'll show you how to test the prototype in your web browser or right on your Amazon Echo!
