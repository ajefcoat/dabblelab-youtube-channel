## Overview
When you're building more complex skills you might run into cases where you'll either want to use the same utterance for multiple intents. Or, you might want to use one intent in multiple ways. For example, let's say you're building a skill that asks a user multiple yes/no questions. There is a built-in 'yes intent' and a built-in 'no intent' but you'll need a way to know which question the user is responding to. This is a case where state handlers could be helpful and that's what we'll discuss in this video.
