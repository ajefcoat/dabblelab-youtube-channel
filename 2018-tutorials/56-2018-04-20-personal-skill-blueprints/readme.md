## Overview
Yesterday (04/19/2018) Amazon introduced [Alexa Skill Blueprints](https://blueprints.amazon.com/), a new way to create personalized skills and responses for Alexa. In this video I'll walk-through how to create a quick Quiz skill and I'll do it in few minutes without writing a single line of code.

Skill Blueprints are a set of easy-to-use templates that anyone can use to create customized experiences for Alexa. It's as easy as filling in the blanks and there are a number of Blueprints to choose from. All you need to do is add your own personalized content and you'll have a skill created in a matter of minutes.

While Skills Blueprints are a fun a new way to build skills for Alexa, all of the skill built with the Blueprints are for personal use and at this point, can't be shared to the public. So, if you want to build skills for sharing, you'll still need to write some code.
