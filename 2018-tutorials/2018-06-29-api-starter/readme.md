## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a custom Alexa skill that uses data from an external API. 

The starting point will be the 'API Starter' skill template from https://SkillTemplates.com. With the template, you can easily modify the code to work with different APIs. We'll step through creating two different skills based on the template; one that provides a random quote and a second that gets the current price of Bitcoin. 

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need to have the Alexa Skills Kit CLI (ASK-CLI) installed and configured. If you don't have the ASK-CLI setup you can go to skilltemplates.com and click the 'getting started' link for a tutorial that will walk you through the process.
