# Saving user attributes in DynamoDB with the ASK SDK 2.0

A common functional requirement for an Alexa skill is the ability to save information about a user that it can be used later to personalize the experience. A simple example would be a skill that ask the user for their name then greets them by name the next time they use the skill. In this tutorial we'll walk through how to do that using the ASK SDK 2.0 and DynamoDB.

We'll be starting with a template from [skilltemplates.com](https://skilltemplates.com) called the 'Attributes Starter' template.
