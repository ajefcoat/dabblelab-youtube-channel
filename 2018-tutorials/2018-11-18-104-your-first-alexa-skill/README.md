## Description

In this Alexa development tutorial, you'll learn how to build your first skill for Amazon Alexa in under 15-minutes - even if you've never written a line of code in your life. This is the 4th revision to this tutorial and was recorded on November 11, 2018. I'm trying to keep this tutorial as current as possible but Amazon updates this stuff often so please let me know in the comments if anything doesn't look right or if you have any questions. I'll respond just a quickly as possible. Thanks for watching and let me know when you get your first skill published!
